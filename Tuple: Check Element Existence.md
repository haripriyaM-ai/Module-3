# EXP 15: Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## Program
```
x=('H','popcorn',8,19,'rice')
n=input()
print(n in x)
print(8 in x)
```

## Output

## Result
Thus, the program is verified successfully.
